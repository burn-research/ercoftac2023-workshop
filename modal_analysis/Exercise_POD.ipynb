    "\n",
    "To apply the POD, the dataset has to be arranged as a data matrix $\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n, m}$, where $n$ represents the number of points in space (pixels) and $m$ is the number of timesteps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we center the dataset by removing the time-wise average field\n",
    "\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "We do this to analyse the fluctuations around the mean. In the KKL theorem, the snapshots are samples form a centered stochastic process. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first step of the POD algorithm consists in computing the covariance matrix $K = \\frac{1}{n-1}\\mathbf{X}_0^T \\mathbf{X}_0$, where each element $K_{i,j}$ is obtained as the inner product between the $i$-th and $j$-th snapshots $K_{i,j} = \\langle \\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{x}_j \\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we compute the eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\mathbf{K} = \\mathbf{V} \\mathbf{L} \\mathbf{V}^T\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The eigenvectors $\\mathbf{V}$ are also called the principal components, and they identify the directions of maximum variance in the dataset.\n",
