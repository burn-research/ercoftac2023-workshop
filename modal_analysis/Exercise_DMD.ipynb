    "# Exercise 2: Dynamic Mode Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "The DMD is a modal analysis technique that is very commonly used to analyse dynamical systems such as reactive turbulent flows. The objective is to find a linear approximation of the dynamical system such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{x}_{k}.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ advances the state of the system $\\mathbf{x}_k$ to the next time $k+1$. In theory, if we split the data matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ into $\\mathbf{X}_1$ and $\\mathbf{X}_2$, where $\\mathbf{X}_1$ contains the snapshots from $k=0$ to $k=m-1$ and $\\mathbf{X}_2$ contains the snapshots from $k=1$ to $k=m$, we can compute $\\mathbf{A}$ as the solution of a least-squares regression problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{X}_2 \\mathbf{X}_1^+,\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{X}_1^+$ denotes the pseudo-inverse of the matrix $\\mathbf{X}_1$. However, the matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ has dimensions $n \\times n$, meaning that for practial applications it is impossible to directly compute it.\n",
    "\n",
    "There exist various algorithms to estimate the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{A}$, which generally rely on the POD to reduce the dimensionality of the problem. We report the \"Exact DMD\" algorithm from Tu et al. [[2]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.0041.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm \n",
    "\n",
    "- Center the dataset by removing the time-average field $\\mathbf{X}_0 = \\mathbf{X} - \\bar{\\mathbf{x}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Split the centered matrix into the matrices $\\mathbf{X}_{0,1}$ and $\\mathbf{X}_{0,2}$, where $\\mathbf{X}_{0,1}$ contains the snapshots from $k=1$ to $k=m-1$ and $\\mathbf{X}_{0,2}$ contains the snapshots from $k=2$ to $k=m$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compute the SVD: $\\mathbf{X}_{0,1} = \\mathbf{U} \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} \\mathbf{V}^T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compute the approximation: $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{A}} = \\mathbf{U}^T \\mathbf{X}_{0,2} \\mathbf{V} \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compute its eigendecomposition: $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{A}} = \\mathbf{W}\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}\\mathbf{W}^T$. $\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}$ contains the DMD eigenvalues.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compute the DMD modes $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi} = \\mathbf{X}_{0,2} \\mathbf{V} \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{-1} \\mathbf{W}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compute the amplitude of the modes as $\\mathbf{b} = \\boldsymbol{\\Phi}^{+} \\mathbf{x}_{,1}$, where $\\mathbf{x}_{0,1}$ is the first snapshot.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The prediction in time is represented as $\\mathbf{x}_k = \\boldsymbol{\\Phi} \\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}^{k} \\mathbf{b}$ (discrete) or by $\\mathbf{x}(t) = \\boldsymbol{\\Phi} \\exp(\\boldsymbol{\\Omega} t) \\mathbf{b}$ (continuous) with $\\boldsymbol{\\omega} = \\log(\\boldsymbol{\\lambda})/ \\Delta t$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "- As the POD, the DMD decouples the spatial information in $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}$ from the temporal information in $\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The DMD modes are not orthogonal. This means that, for example, the energy content of a group of modes is not the sum of the energy of the single modes, because they can have partially overlapping energy. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The identification of the most important modes is not straightforward. Generally, we sort them by the amplitude or by the average energy content.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The interpretation of modes with a decaying or exploding growth factors is challenging because they could represent either a non-linear physical phenomenon or noise.\n",
